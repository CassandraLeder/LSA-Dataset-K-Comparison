A corpus represents a vocabulary encoded in a semantic space. This project explores the semantic consequences of Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) on a semantic space by creating a network of LSA models whose relationships represent how LSA qua a network of documents re-encodes the semantic space of a corpus, thereby modifying the semantics of a corpus. These semantic consequences can be analyzed first through relationships in the network of documents, cosine similarity and their z-scores, then through relationships in the network of models, pearson correlation. Finally, these semantic consequences can be analyzed through human interpretaion at a document level via Van Rips diagrams (persistent homology) and an analysis of the signifiers that compose documents.
